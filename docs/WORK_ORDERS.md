# Work orders — implementation map

Work orders are a **priority workflow** for engineering managers. Do not invent or silently change status semantics without explicit product approval.

## Authoritative status values (current backend)

From backend `app/routers/maintenance.py` stats and filters:

| Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| `pending` | Default on create (`WorkOrderCreate.status`) |
| `in-progress` | Hyphenated string in DB |
| `completed` | Used for overdue logic exclusion |
| `on-hold` | Hyphenated string in DB |

Overdue calculation treats rows with `due_date` and `status != 'completed'`. Any new status must be wired through stats, filters, and UI consistently.

## Code locations

| Layer | Path |
|--------|------|
| API | backend repo `app/routers/maintenance.py` — CRUD, stats, dashboard aggregates |
| UI page | `app/maintenance/page.tsx` |
| Modals / forms | `components/maintenance/CreateWorkOrderModal.tsx`, `WorkOrderDetailModal.tsx`, `formFields.tsx`, `analytics.tsx` |
| Related ops | Breakdowns, requisitions, spares, equipment pages may link or reference maintenance context — grep before assuming isolation |

## Journey checklist (when touching WOs)

- [ ] Create / edit / assign / schedule fields persist correctly (`exclude_unset` on PATCH — no null-clear regressions).
- [ ] List filters, sort, and search preserve context when opening and returning from detail.
- [ ] Status and priority visible at a glance; overdue distinguishable from on-track.
- [ ] Completion vs formal closure: preserve any business distinction already in UI copy and fields — do not merge without approval.
- [ ] Documents, notes, spares, and history reachable from the record where the app already supports them.
- [ ] Errors surface to the user; empty list ≠ failed load.
- [ ] Stats on homepage/maintenance dashboard reconcile with filtered lists.

## Metrics

If adding reporting (closure rate, backlog age, on-time completion), document numerator/denominator/period/status set in the PR or doc **before** implementing. Reuse `get_work_order_stats()` patterns or extend them — do not duplicate conflicting counts.
